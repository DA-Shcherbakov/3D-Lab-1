abstract = {Abstract Driven by recent advances in rapid multiphoton single-focus 3D laser nanoprinting, multifocus variants thereof, and projection-based multiphoton 3D laser nanoprinting, the necessary average total laser powers from femtosecond laser oscillators or even from amplified femtosecond laser systems have exceeded the Watt level. Aiming at ever faster 3D printing, there exist two options: Using yet more powerful lasers or searching for more sensitive photoresists allowing for higher speeds at comparable or lower power levels. Here, altogether more than 70 different photoresists from the literature and a few new candidates are reviewed with regard to effective multiphoton sensitivity. A dimensionless sensitivity figure-of-merit allows to directly compare data taken under sometimes vastly different conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract Direct laser writing has become a versatile and routine tool for the mask-free fabrication of polymer structures with lateral linewidths down to less than 100 nm. In contrast to its planar counterpart, electron-beam lithography, direct laser writing also allows for the making of three-dimensional structures. However, its spatial resolution has been restricted by diffraction. Clearly, linewidths and resolutions on the scale of few tens of nanometers and below are highly desirable for various applications in nanotechnology. In visible-light far-field fluorescence microscopy, the concept of stimulated emission depletion (STED) introduced in 1994 has led to spectacular record resolutions down to 5.6 nm in 2009. This review addresses approaches aiming at translating this success in optical microscopy to optical lithography. After explaining basic principles and limitations, possible depletion mechanisms and recent lithography experiments by various groups are summarized. Today, Abbe's diffraction barrier as well as the generalized two-photon Sparrow criterion have been broken in far-field optical lithography. For further future progress in resolution, the development of novel tailored photoresists in combination with attractive laser sources is of utmost importance.},

Here, a series of femtosecond-laser-mediated fabrication strategies, including the two-photon reduction of metal ions, template-assisted metal coating and metal filling, photodynamic assembly of metal nanoparticles, and selective nanoparticle sintering, are summarized. Additionally, abundant applications in microelectronics, metamaterials, near-field optics, microfluidics, micromechanics, and microsensors are introduced in detail.

pages={51-54},
abstract={Two-photon excitation provides a means of activating chemical or physical processes with high spatial resolution in three dimensions and has made possible the development of three-dimensional fluorescence imaging1, optical data storage2,3 and lithographic microfabrication4,5,6. These applications take advantage of the fact that the two-photon absorption probability depends quadratically on intensity, so under tight-focusing conditions, the absorption is confined at the focus to a volume of order $\lambda$3 (where $\lambda$ is the laser wavelength). Any subsequent process, such as fluorescence or a photoinduced chemical reaction, is also localized in this small volume. Although three-dimensional data storage and microfabrication have been illustrated using two-photon-initiated polymerization of resins incorporating conventional ultraviolet-absorbing initiators, such photopolymer systems exhibit low photosensitivity as the initiators have small two-photon absorption cross-sections ($\delta$). Consequently, this approach requires high laser power, and its widespread use remains impractical. Here we report on a class of $\pi$;-conjugated compounds that exhibit large $\delta$ (as high as 1, 250 {\texttimes} 10−50 cm4 s per photon) and enhanced two-photon sensitivity relative to ultraviolet initiators. Two-photon excitable resins based on these new initiators have been developed and used to demonstrate a scheme for three-dimensional data storage which permits fluorescent and refractive read-out, and the fabrication of three-dimensional micro-optical and micromechanical structures, including photonic-bandgap-type structures7.},

The said quantity was determined from the transmission IR-spectrum of the materials before and after polymerization. For proprietary resins the quantity of remaining double bonds was found to vary between 23 and 43\%. For experimental, chemically cured resins die quantity in question was found to decrease with increasing resin content of amine and peroxide, and to increase with the content ofinhibitor. The content of peroxide was the more influential of the three factors. For constant content of amine, peroxide, and inhibitor the number of remaining double bonds decreased with increasing content of diluting monomer in BISGMA-based monomer mixtures. The use of a trifunctional monomer as diluting monomer did not give rise to a higher degree of conversion of the double bonds in comparison to a bifunctional diluting monomer. The quantity of remaining double bonds of a light curing material was relatively smaM when compared to the quantity present in chemically cured materials of adequate setting time.},

Diametral tensile strength, compressive strength, hardness, flexural modulus and strength, and dynamic mechanical properties were tested, and the results were correlated to the degree of conversion results obtained by infrared analysis. The results showed a significant correlation between increased mechanical properties and higher degrees of conversion. Enhanced conversions were achieved by incorporating higher diluent and lower inhibitor concentrations into the resins. Ambient temperature properties were similarly enhanced by lower inhibitor concentrations, but were not enhanced by higher diluent concentration. Dynamic mechanical properties testing at oral and elevated temperatures elucidated possible differences in resin microstructure and network quality. The storage moduli decreased over the dental temperature range and was lower at all temperatures for resins with lower conversions. The glass transition temperature was also lower in resins with poorer conversions, suggesting that these resins may be more unstable at oral temperatures than more highly converted resins. Dynamic mechanical properties were most closely correlated to degree of conversion in these polymeric systems.},

abstract = {3D Direct laser writing (3D DLW) based on two photon polymerization represents a powerful technique for the additive manufacturing of 3D micro- and nano-structures, which have a number of promising applications in areas including biology and cell cultures up to soft robotic. New applications often entail the contact and movement of nanoscale areas, therefore understanding of the mechanical properties involved in such systems is necessary for creating reliable micro and nanoscale applications. Notably, knowledge about nanomechanics of 3D printed structures and its dependence on its geometry and contact size remains essential. This study focuses on the investigation of the Young’s modulus of 3D printed microstructures by Atomic Force Microscopy. Using the PeakForce QNM AFM mode, it was possible to determine the influence of the laser power and the monomer and their mixture on the micromechanical properties, in particular the Young's modulus. The fabricated structures are 2D structures, consisting of successive lines forming a square. Three different resins have been used based on poly(ethyleneglycol)diacrylate (PEGDA), trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA). The results obtained show that the increase in laser power increases the Young's modulus of these raw materials, since it induces a stronger crosslinking density. Mixtures of resins have also been formulated inducing a Young's modulus structure increase when increasing the amount of PETA. By combining these two approaches, tuning of the nanomechanical properties of the final microstructures on an unprecedented range covering 3 orders of magnitude, from MPa up to GPa have been successfully achieved. This major result paves the way to in-depth reflection on future works in nanorobotics or biomedical devices, where complex mechanical behavior are highly desired.}

This investigation deals with the description of a calorimetric test method for the direct determination of the prepolymer reactivity and its final degree of cure. The analytical technique uses a modified differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) capable of direct measurements of heat fluxes generated during the UV-activated polymerization of photoinitiated acrylic prepolymers.

Today, these mixtures are still present, but urethane dimethacrylates and large oligomeric structures of BIS-GMA-urethanes exist. Because of these changes in composition, the past methods of calculating monomer conversion by means of infrared spectroscopy may need modification. This research investigates different methods used to formulate calibration curves for determination of monomer conversion by infrared spectroscopy of contemporary commercial composites containing aromatic structures. Conversion calibration procedures using various baseline methods with BIS-GMA, Bisphenol-A/TEGDMA, and a hydrogenated bonding resin were established. Both peak and area infrared absorptions were determined. One particular baseline method proved the best fit to the Beer-Lambert law. Bisphenol-A was found unsuitable as an infrared calibration model for resin composites. The BIS-GMA/TEGDMA calibration model closely simulates conversion values obtained when a hydrogenated commercial resin model was used.}

pages={16001},
abstract={Acoustic metamaterials can manipulate and control sound waves in ways that are not possible in conventional materials. Metamaterials with zero, or even negative, refractive index for sound offer new possibilities for acoustic imaging and for the control of sound at subwavelength scales. The combination of transformation acoustics theory and highly anisotropic acoustic metamaterials enables precise control over the deformation of sound fields, which can be used, for example, to hide or cloak objects from incident acoustic energy. Active acoustic metamaterials use external control to create effective material properties that are not possible with passive structures and have led to the development of dynamically reconfigurable, loss-compensating and parity--time-symmetric materials for sound manipulation. Challenges remain, including the development of efficient techniques for fabricating large-scale metamaterial structures and converting laboratory experiments into useful devices. In this Review, we outline the designs and properties of materials with unusual acoustic parameters (for example, negative refractive index), discuss examples of extreme manipulation of sound and, finally, provide an overview of future directions in the field.},

abstract={Metamaterials are rationally designed composites aiming at effective material parameters that go beyond those of the ingredient materials. For example, negative metamaterial properties, such as the refractive index, thermal expansion coefficient or Hall coefficient, can be engineered from constituents with positive parameters. Likewise, large metamaterial parameter values can arise from all-zero constituents, such as magnetic from non-magnetic, chiral from achiral and anisotropic from isotropic. The field of metamaterials emerged from linear electromagnetism two decades ago and today addresses nearly all conceivable aspects of solids, ranging from electromagnetic and optical, and mechanical and acoustic to transport properties --- linear and nonlinear, reciprocal and non-reciprocal, monostable and multistable (programmable), active and passive, and static and dynamic. In this Review, we focus on the general case of 3D periodic metamaterials, with electromagnetic or optical, acoustic or mechanical, transport or stimuli-responsive properties. We outline the fundamental bounds of these composites and summarize the state of the art in theoretical design and experimental realization.},

However, the wide range of mechanical properties that results from the chosen combination of multiple process parameters imposes an obstacle to its widespread use. Here we introduce a thermal post-curing route as an effective and simple method to increase the mechanical properties of acrylate-based TPP-DLW-derived parts by 20-250\&\#x0025; and to largely eliminate the characteristic coupling of processing parameters, material properties and part functionality. We identify the underlying mechanism of the property enhancement as a self-initiated thermal curing reaction, which robustly facilitates the high property reproducibility that is essential for any application of TPP-DLW.},

We propose a new architecture and a novel self-adjustment approach that automatically compensate for imperfect fabricated split ratios anywhere from 85\&\#x2236;15 to 15\&\#x2236;85. The entire mesh can be both optimized and programmed after initial fabrication, with progressive algorithms, without calculations or calibration, and even using only sources and detectors external to the mesh. Hence, one universal field-programmable linear array optical element could be mass fabricated, with broad process tolerances, and then configured automatically for a wide range of complex and precise linear optical functions.},

Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (10 12 MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs 3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates 3-5 , ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides 6,7 , and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services. The increased demand for machine learning on very large datasets 2 and the growing offering of AI services on the cloud 8,9 has driven a resurgence in custom hardware designed to accelerate MAC computations the fundamental mathematical element needed for matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations. Although various custom silicon computing hardware-that is, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) 10 , ASICs 11 and graphics processing units (GPUs) 12-have been developed to improve computational throughput and efficiency, they still depend on the same underlying electronic components, which are fundamentally limited in both speed and energy by Joule heating , electromagnetic crosstalk and capacitance 13. The last of these (capacitance) dominates energy consumption and limits the maximum operating speed in neural network hardware accelerators 14. This is because, the movement of data (for example, trained network weights), rather than arithmetic operations, requires the charging and discharging of chip-level metal interconnects. Thus, improving the efficiency of logic gates at the device level provides diminutive returns in such applications, if the flow of data during computation is not simultaneously addressed 15. Even recent developments such as memristive crossbar arrays 16-19 to compute in the analogue domain, although promising, do not have the potential for parallelizing the MVM operations (except by physical replication of the elements of the matrix). Moreover, they are plagued by the same limitations of electronic addressing 20 , with additional challenges in the manufacturing and implementation due to issues with device variability 21,22 , cyclability 23 and drift 24,25. Integrated photonics benefits from the modularity and scalable fabrication methods of integrated circuits, while having two key advantages over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in conjunction with multichannel sources (that is, optical frequency combs); and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds limited only by the bandwidth of on-chip optical modulators and photodetectors. These uniquely pho-tonic advantages have led to the ubiquity of optical networks for information transfer and are at present revolutionizing data centre interconnects https://doi.},

   abstract = {Flexible ultra-compact low-loss optical waveguides play a vital role in the development of soft photonics. The search for suitable materials and innovative fabrication techniques to achieve low loss long polymer optical waveguides and interconnects has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of submicron optical waveguides in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using divinylbenzene (DVB) as the photopolymerizable monomer through two-photon polymerization (2PP). We show that the commercial oxime ester photoinitiator Irgacure OXE02 is suitable for triggering the DVB photopolymerization, resulting in a stable and controllable fabrication process for the fabrication of defect-free, 5-cm long waveguides. We further explore a multi-track fabrication strategy to enlarge the waveguide core size up to ~3 µm for better light confinement and reduced cross-talk. In these waveguides, we measured a refractive index contrast on the order of 0.005 and a transmission loss of 0.1 dB/cm at 710 nm wavelength.},

abstract = {Photonic waveguides are prime candidates for integrated and parallel photonic interconnects. Such interconnects correspond to large-scale vector matrix products, which are at the heart of neural network computation. However, parallel interconnect circuits realized in two dimensions, for example, by lithography, are strongly limited in size due to disadvantageous scaling. We use three-dimensional (3D) printed photonic waveguides to overcome this limitation. 3D optical couplers with fractal topology efficiently connect large numbers of input and output channels, and we show that the substrate's area and height scale linearly. Going beyond simple couplers, we introduce functional circuits for discrete spatial filters identical to those used in deep convolutional neural networks.}

abstract = {Stimuli-responsive microstructures are critical to create adaptable systems in soft robotics and biosciences. For such applications, the materials must be compatible with aqueous environments and enable the manufacturing of three-dimensional structures. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) is a well-established polymer, exhibiting a substantial response to changes in temperature close to its lower critical solution temperature. To create complex actuation patterns, materials that react differently with respect to a stimulus are required. Here, we introduce functional three-dimensional hetero-microstructures based on pNIPAM. By variation of the local exposure dose in three-dimensional laser lithography, we demonstrate that the material parameters can be altered on demand in a single resist formulation. We explore this concept for sophisticated three-dimensional architectures with large-amplitude and complex responses. The experimental results are consistent with numerical calculations, able to predict the actuation response. Furthermore, a spatially controlled response is achieved by inducing a local temperature increase by two-photon absorption of focused light.}

abstract = {An approach is presented to align the direction of liquid crystal networks or elastomers in situ during multi-photon laser printing for each voxel in three dimensions by applying a quasi-static electric field with variable orientation. This approach enables the making of 3D micro-heterostructures operating under ambient conditions that show large-amplitude elastic actuation, with temperature serving as the stimulus (“4D microstructures”). The approach involves two novelties. First, a dedicated sample cell with a variable height suitable for laser printing is introduced. It is based on optically transparent electrodes and allows to apply arbitrary electric field vectors in three dimensions, for example, parallel or normal to the substrate plane. Second, a variable optical phase plate combined with a pivotable half-wave plate warrants a single well-defined laser focus for nearly all possible quasi-static electric field vectors. Without the latter, one generally obtains two spatially separated laser foci, an ordinary and an extraordinary one, due to the optical birefringence of the medium induced by the alignment of the liquid crystal director via the applied quasi-static electric field. The versatility of the approach is illustrated by manufacturing and characterizing several exemplary architectures.}
